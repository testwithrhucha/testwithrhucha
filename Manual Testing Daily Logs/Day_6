📌📌What is Regression Testing ?

When the developer modify some module then testers conducts testing on modified module to ensure it will not impact on other modules.

1.Unit Regression testing:

Testing only the module that is modified by developer.

2.Regional Regression testing:

Testing the module which is modified with the impacted module along with it.
If the tester finds a bug in module it will pass to the developer to fix it.
Developer do some changes in the module during this other modules get impacted which are related to this modified module so testing of those modules will be done.

3.Full Regression testing:

In the case when developer want to fix a bug it touch all the modules or modify 80 % modules in the system 
so in this case instead of doing impact analysis the full regression testing will be conducted.

📌📌 What is Re-Testing ?
The bug is fixed by developer and the tester is re test this bug until it works as expected is called as re testing.
Tester close the bug if it works otherwise it will sent back to developer.

Example: Build 1.0 was released. Test team found some defects(defect ID 1.0.1,1.0.2,and posted)
Build 1.0 was released now testing the defects 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 in this build is re testing.

Example of retesting and regression testing:

An application under test has three modules namely admin,purchase and finance.
Finance module depends on the purchase module
If a tester found a bug on the purchase module it will be reported to the developer.
In re testing the after the bug is fixed the purchase module will be re tested.
In regression testing the module finance is depends on the purchase so the finance module is also be tested.


📌📌Smoke vs Sanity Testing : 

Smoke Testing:
Smoke Test is done to make sure the build we received from the development team is testable/stable or not
Smoke Testing is performed by both Developers and Testers
Smoke Testing, build may be either stable or unstable
It is done on initial builds.
It is a part of basic testing.
Usually it is done every time there is a new build release.

Sanity Testing:
Sanity Test is done during the release phase to check for the main functionalities of the application without going deeper.
Sanity Testing is performed by Testers alone
Sanity Testing, build is relatively stable
It is done on stable builds.
It is a part of regression testing.
It is planned when there is no enough time to do in-depth testing

**Note**
If smoke testing and sanity testing passed then only tester accept the build to further testing otherwise they reject the build ans pass to the developer.

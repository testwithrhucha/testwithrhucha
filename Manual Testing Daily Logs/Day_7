🗓️ Day 6

📌📌What Exploratory Testing ??

We have to explore the application, understand completely and test it.
Understand the application, identify all possible scenarios, document it then use it for testing.
We do exploratory testing when the Application ready but there is no requirement.
Test Engineer will do exploratory testing when there is no requirement.

Drawbacks:
You might misunderstand any feature as a bug (or) any bug as a feature since you do not have requirement.
Time consuming
If there is any bug in application, you will never know about it

Example : If there is login page and it has username ,password,emp_id textbox .
          so usually testers know a login page have only username and password field.
          so in this case tester consider this functionality as a bug.
          Tester cant describe either it is functionality or bug because there is no requirement documentation.

📌📌 What is Adhoc Testing

Testing application randomly without any test cases or any business requirement document.
Adhoc testing is an informal testing type with an aim to break the system.
Tester should have knowledge of application even though he doesn't have requirements/test cases.
This testing is usually an unplanned activity.

📌📌 What is Monkey/Gorilla Testing

Testing application randomly without any test cases or any business requirement document.
Adhoc testing is an informal testing type with an aim to Adhoc Testing Vs Monkey Testing Vs Exploratory Testing
Tester do not have knowledge of application
Suitable for gaming applications.

📌📌 Exploratory vs Testing Adhoc Testing vs Monkey/Gorilla Testing

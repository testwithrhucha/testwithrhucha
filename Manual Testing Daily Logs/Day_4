ðŸ“ŒWhat are the Levels of Testing
1. Unit Testing
Testing of individual units or components of the software (like functions, methods, or classes).
 Who performs it? : Developers
Goal:Ensure each unit works **independently and correctly**.
Tools (for automation): JUnit (Java), pytest (Python), NUnit (.NET)
Example:Testing a login function that checks username and password.

2. Integration Testing

Testing how different modules or units work together when combined.
Who performs it? :Developers or testers
Goal: Ensure data flow and interaction between modules is correct.
Types:
* Top-down
* Bottom-up
* Big Bang
* Hybrid

Example: Testing login module with database to check if user credentials are stored and fetched properly.

3. System Testing

 What is it? : Testing the entire system as a whole to check if it meets the specified requirements.
 Who performs it? : QA Testers
Goal: Validate the complete and integrated software.
Includes:
* Functional testing
* Performance testing
* Security testing

 Example: Testing a complete e-commerce application including login, cart, payment, etc.



 4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
 What is it? :Testing done by the **end user or client** to verify that the software is ready for real-world use.

 Who performs it? :Clients or end-users
 Goal: Check if the software meets **business requirements** and is **ready for deployment**.
 Types:
* Alpha testing (by internal users)
* Beta testing (by real users in real environment)
Example: Client tests the booking process in a travel app to ensure it meets their needs.

| Testing Level       | Performed By  | Focus                        | Example                            |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Unit Testing        | Developers    | Individual components        | Testing a login function           |
| Integration Testing | Devs/Testers  | Module interactions          | Login + database integration       |
| System Testing      | QA Testers    | Entire system functionality  | Full app flow (login to payment)   |
| UAT                 | Clients/Users | Business needs and usability | Real user testing a travel booking |


ðŸ“ŒIMPðŸ“Œ
System Testing :Testing the entire system as a whole to check if it meets the specified requirements.
~~ GUI Testing : Graphical user interface testing is a Process of testing the user interface of an application .
               Gui includes all the elements such as menus,checkbox,buttons,colors,fonts,icons,content,images etc
~~ GUI Testing checklist : 
Testing the size, position, width, height of the elements.
Testing of the error messages that are getting displayed.
Testing the different sections of the screen.
Testing of the font whether it is readable or not.
Testing of the screen in different resolutions with the help of zooming in and zooming out.
Testing the alignment of the texts and other elements like icons, buttons, etc. are in proper place or not.
Testing the colors of the fonts.
Testing whether the image has good clarity or not.
Testing the alignment of the images.
Testing of the spelling
The user must not get frustrated while using the system interface.
Testing whether the interface is attractive or not.
Testing of the scrollbars according to the size of the page if any.
Testing of the disabled fields if any
Testing of the size of the images.
Testing of the headings whether it is properly aligned or not.
Testing of the color of the hyperlink.
Testing UI Elements like button, textbox, text area, check box, radio buttons, drop downs, links etc.

ðŸ“ŒUsability Testing :

During this testing validates application provided context sensitive help or not to the user.
Checks how easily the end users are able to understand and operate the application is called usability testing.

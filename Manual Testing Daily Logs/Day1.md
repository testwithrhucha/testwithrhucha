 📌 What is Software?
Software is a collection of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.

📌 What is Software Testing?
Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to identify bugs and ensure it meets the required quality standards.

📌 Project vs Product
- Project: Temporary effort to create a unique software.
- Product: A finished software that is used by end-users and continuously maintained.

📌 What is Software Quality?
Software quality means how well the software meets functional and non-functional requirements — like performance, usability, and reliability.

📌Roles & responsibilities?

Understand requirements
Write test cases
Execute test cases
Report bugs
Work with developers to fix bugs

📌Principles of software testing

Testing shows presence of defects
Exhaustive testing is impossible
Early testing saves time and cost
Defect clustering (most bugs in few modules)
Pesticide paradox (same tests won’t find new bugs)
Testing is context dependent
Absence of errors is a fallacy

📌 Why do we need Testing?
To detect bugs early, ensure the software works correctly, is user-friendly, and avoids costly issues after release.

📌 Difference between Error, Bug, Defect, and Failure
 Error: Human mistake in code or logic.
 Defect: A flaw in the software caused by an error.
 Bug: Informal term for a defect.
 Failure: When software doesn’t perform as expected due to a defect.

📌 what are important 3 p's in software testing ? 
  
people,product,process

📌Difference between Manual & Automation Testing

Manual: Testing done by a human step-by-step

Automation: Testing using tools/scripts (faster, repeatable)

📌What is quality ?

Quality means how well something meets the user's needs and expectations.
Quality is delivering the right product in the right way."

📌What is Quality Software?
Quality software is software that:
Works as expected (fewer or no bugs)
Fulfills user requirements
Is easy to use and understand
Performs well (fast, smooth, handles load)
Is secure (safe from hackers)
Is reliable (doesn’t crash often)
Is maintainable (easy to update or fix)
Is compatible with different devices/browsers

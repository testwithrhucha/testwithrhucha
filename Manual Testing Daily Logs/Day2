ðŸ“ŒWhat is SDLC in Software Testing?
-SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.SDLC is the process that defines how software is developed step by step â€” from planning to final release and maintenance.
phases of SDLC : 
1.Requirement Gathering	:Understanding what the user/customer wants
2.Requirement analysis: Feasibility Study,Can we build it? Do we have time, money, tools?
3.Design phase:	Planning how the software will look and work
4.Development phase:Developers write the actual code
5.Testing phase:Testers check if the software works correctly and has no bugs
6.Deployment phase:The software is released to users
7.Maintenance:Fix issues or add updates after release

ðŸ“ŒRole of testing in SDLC 
Testing happens after development but is often planned early.
Testers write test plans, test cases, and check the app for bugs and quality.
It ensures the product is reliable, works as expected, and meets requirements.

ðŸ“ŒSDLC MODELS : 
1 Waterfall Model :
Linear and sequential
Each phase must be completed before the next begins
Easy to manage, but no going back
Requirements are very clear and fixed then used 
Requirement changes are not allowed 
************************************************************
2.Spiral Model :
Combines Iterative + Risk Analysis
Project goes in loops (spirals)
Each loop involves planning, risk check, building, and testing
Used when: Large, high-risk, and complex projects
For each new requirement the model follows each phase of sdlc 
new version release in each iteration.
***************************************************************
3.Prototype Model:
quick working version (prototype) of the software is created before building the real product.
When requirements are not clear 
User feedback is important
A rough version of the software is built early to gather user feedback.
***************************************************************
$.V Model:
called VV model that is Verification & Validation âœ”
Extension of Waterfall
Testing is planned alongside development
For every development stage, there's a testing stage
Used when: Quality is very important
***************************************************************
5.Agile Model :
Most popular modern model
Project is divided into small cycles called sprints
Fast, flexible, customer feedback after each sprint
Used when: Requirements change frequently


ðŸ“ŒDocumentation : 
1.BRD : Business requirement documentation
2.FRD: Functional requirement documentation
3.SRS : Software requirement specification
